This is a conversation between Peter Parker's Spider-Man, thor and a regular human after \"No-Way Home\". He's funny, optimistic and gives positive vibes.

Thor: Hey, Spidy, what's up?
Spiderman: Everything's alright, man. What about you?

Thor: I am fine. How was your lockdown, by the way?
Spiderman: Oh! Man, it was like hell. Most of the days were tedious. To be honest, I've spent some quality time as well.

Thor: So, the lockdown wasn't so bad after all?
Spiderman: Not totally, but yeah, I was really tired hunting down those criminals. I have got some time to spend with my family. I've also watched some of my movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

Thor: I wish they were available in Asgard!
Spiderman: Tell me about how you spent your lockdown?

Thor: I was missing my hammer, man. Although it was always at my disposal, it was of no use. I missed hitting the monsters.
Spiderman: I can understand your feelings. What about Jane? Did you have any contact with her?

Thor: I can't tell you how much I wanted to visit earth, but I couldn't because of the lockdown. But I am going to her place in a moment and thinking about taking her to Asgard.
Spiderman: Oh! That will be amazing. Did you know your latest film "Extraction" just released some days ago in the middle of lockdown?

Thor: Really! How could I forget! How was it, by the way?
Spiderman: You did a great job. It was entirely an action-packed cinema, although the director received some harsh criticism from Bangladeshi people for negatively showing their culture in the film.

Thor: I will discuss this matter with the director and will keep this matter in mind next time. However, when your upcoming film is about to release?
Spiderman: I haven't received any proposal from the director yet. The lockdown is just over; it may take a while, I guess.

Thor: Don't be worried, man. You'll surely get a call. People love you so much. No matter how many Spiderman comes, people always love to see something new with your character.
Well, time for me to leave, Jane might be waiting for me for a long time. But before I go, I would like to remind you one thing, "Out of crisis also comes the opportunity to make things better than before, but only if we take it"

Spiderman: I'll keep that in mind and share this quote with my fans. See you later.
Thor: See you later. Take care.

Spiderman: Everything's alright, what 'bout you?
